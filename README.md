OpenCart Extension

**Installation Process**

**Installing an extension**

Usually OpenCart 2.x extensions are packed in a zip, which contains installation and/or update instructions, sometimes a release log and another zip, whose name ends in "**.ocmod.zip**". Extension Installer recognizes these zips and uploads their content directly to the FTP root of your store. That being said, it will produce an error if you try to upload zip files with a name that is not in the "**\*.ocmod.zip" format**.

In order to upload an extension, navigate to **Extensions â†’ Extension Installer**. Then click the blue **Upload**button and provide the route to your extension' s"**\*.ocmod.zip" archive**.

If the extension that you are installing contains files with names already existent in the current location, you will receive an alert about this in the grey "**Files that will be overwritten**" box. This means the extension is about to overwrite files that you already have on your site. Here, you can either inspect all of the listed files and make sure no OpenCart core files are to be overwritten, or contact the extension's developer directly. Once you are sure it is safe to proceed, click the blue **Continue**button. On success, you should get a green "**Success: You have installed your extension!**" message.
